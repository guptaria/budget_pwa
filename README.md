## General_Info
<b>What is Progressive Web Application (PWA)?</b>
* A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web app that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users. These apps meet certain requirements (see below), are deployed to servers, accessible through URLs, and indexed by search engines.
<b>What is required for PWA?</b>
To be considered a Progressive Web App, your app must be:

* Progressive - Work for every user, regardless of browser choice, because they are built with progressive enhancement as a core tenet.
* Responsive - Fit any form factor, desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever is next.

* Connectivity independent - Enhanced with service workers to work offline or on low quality networks.

* App-like - Use the app-shell model to provide app-style navigation and interactions.

* Fresh - Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.

* Safe - Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping and ensure content has not been tampered with.

* Discoverable - Are identifiable as “applications” thanks to W3C manifests and service worker registration scope allowing search engines to find them.

* Re-engageable - Make re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.

* Installable - Allow users to “keep” apps they find most useful on their home screen without the hassle of an app store.

* Linkable - Easily share via URL and not require complex installation.

<b>Offline Support</b>
* Apps should be able to work offline. Whether that be displaying a proper "offline" message or caching app data for display purpose.
